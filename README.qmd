The [Quarto](https://quarto.org) extension that allows you to generate [D2](https://d2lang.com) diagrams directly within your markdown documents. You can specify various attributes to control the appearance and layout of the diagrams. 

This extension draws inspiration from [`ram02z/d2-filter`](https://github.com/ram02z/d2-filter).

## Installing

Before you can use this extension, you'll need to make sure you've installed the d2 CLI utility.

Next, use the `quarto add` command to install the extension:

```bash
quarto add data-intuitive/quarto-d2
```

This will install the extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory.
If you're using version control, you will want to check in this directory.

## Example

Here is the source code for a [minimal example](example.qmd):


````markdown
---
title: "D2 Example"
filters:
  - d2
---

```{.d2}
x -> y
```
````

With this setup, the `d2` filter will process any code blocks with the `.d2` class, applying the attributes you specify.

That's it! Now you know how to use the `d2` filter to generate diagrams in your quarto documents.
